`uaz-revealjs` is a template for Quarto revealjs slides with University of Arizona branding (fonts, colors, and logo.)

## Installation

To use this theme, first install it from GitHub using the following shell command:

``` bash
quarto add cct-datascience/uaz-revealjs
```

This will create a `_extensions` folder in your working directory with the necessary resources in it. Then, use `uaz-revealjs` as the format.

```yml
---
title: "Presentation"
author: "Your Name"
format: uaz-revealjs
---
```

If you'd also like to install the template .qmd file, you can instead use:

``` bash
quarto use template cct-datascience/uaz-revealjs
```
